# Coding Assessment CSharp
 
## Background
This assessment was created using a Windows 11 virtual machine on my Linux desktop. A MySQL database, called "products", is hosted locally and contains a table called "productsList". Here, product codes, names, and prices are stored. The program was developed using Visual Studio as a console app and written in C#.

## How it works

// Initialize the connection to the database

// Retrieve the list of products and store them in an object

// Print a table to the console showing the available products, codes, and prices

// Get user's input for the product code and quantity to add to cart

// Add the user's input to a cart

// Display the cart on the screen

// Calculate the amount saved from discounts (buy on red flower, get one half off)

// Calculate shipping cost

// Calculate total

// Display total
